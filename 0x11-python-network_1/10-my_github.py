"""
Python script that takes your GitHub credentials (username and password)
and uses the GitHub API to display your id
    - You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as
        password to access to your information (only read:user
        permission is needed)
    - The first argument will be your username
    - The second argument will be your password (in your case, a personal
        access token as password)
    - You must use the package requests and sys
    - You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
    - You don’t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
